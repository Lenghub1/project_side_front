### 0.0.1 (2024-02-06)

### Feature

- Layout Setting (Before Auth, After Auth, TopBar, SideBar, Body)
- API Setting : The current prototype does not connect directly to the API, but localstorage is replacing the role of network communication. Please connect to the actual backend server later to use it.
- React Component Setting : This as an example of how to use functional components that are basically used in React. Currently, the business logic and view logic are in one file, but if the project grows or the components grow in the future, it is better to separate them.
- Routing : Routing settings in Route folder
- Style : Styling can be made globally reusable or scoped within a component.
- State management : Use Recoil for state management.
